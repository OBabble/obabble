As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.


But I still want one.


Yes -- ....


Stop that dog!


This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!


Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!


-- Ruined my exit!


Help!


Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!


Beautiful!  What an echo!


It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.


I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!


I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?


No, sir!


No, sir!


That's right.


We do.


It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.




To Oz!


To Oz?


Animals that -- that eat straw?


Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.


I'd be gentle as a lizard --


I'd be clever as a gizzard --


Then I'm sure to get a brain --


It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.


A heart --


Come on -- come on --


Hurry -- hurry --


Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!


Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!


Emerald City!


Hey, Dorothy!


Dorothy!


Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!


Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!


Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.


I don't think I could, but we could try.


Let's.


Yes.
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!


Here, Tin Man -- help me.


Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!


It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!


It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!


Ha -- ha -- ha --


Ho -- ho --ho


Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!


I can fairly hear my heart beating!


Oh, did - did you see that?


Oh - look out.


You know something?


Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!


I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.


It's a whozis.


It's a whozis?


Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!


Oh!  Well, what happened to you?


They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!


Well, that's you all over.


Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!


Now, now, don't fret.


Oh, dear, dear.


We'll get you together!


Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.


But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's....


...to Dorothy!


Oh --


Come on, fellows!


Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out.


Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.


No, you don't.


Oh, no!


Whew! That wasn't my plan - but something happened, didn't it?


You put up a great fight, Lion.


Yeah --


I don't know what we'd have done without you.


Oh - upstairs, quickly!


Go on!


Hey -- what about Dorothy?


Yes -- how about Dorothy?


...Tin Man!


Ohhhh -- it's me!


...junk!


Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --


Quiet!


Ohhhhhh!


...of the West.


B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!


Here -- here. Go 'way and let us alone!


Oh, scared, huh?


I haven't slept in weeks.


Why don't you try counting sheep?


That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.


Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!


Not even a rhinoceros?


Imposserous!


From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.


She - she can have my Witch Remover.


What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away!


Hold still - hold still --


It's a whatzis.


It's a whatzis?


Whozat?


Whozat?


Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.


Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.


Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.


There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.


Yeah --


...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.


I hope your tail holds out. Oh --


No?  Now, wait a minute.


You don't neither --


Where do we go now?


Yeah.


...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!


Don't push!


You don't get around us that easy!


Lions and tigers and bears!


Lions and tigers and bears!


Lions and tigers and bears!


Lions and tigers and bears!


Oh, my!


Oh, my!


Oh, my!


Oh, my!


Oil can.....Oil can....


Did you say something?


Oil can....


Where do you want to be oiled first?


My mouth -- my mouth!


...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.


Oh...


Oh --


...Oh, did that hurt?


No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---


Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?


Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....


My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!


Well, you're perfect now.


Oh --!


Oh --


All hollow.  Oh --
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?


I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.


Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.


Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.


Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?


Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already.


Ohh -- what's that? Oh --


Oh! They're - they're gone now.


Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?


I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.


Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!


Oh - I'll get it!


Oh! Oh!


Oh --


Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!


Oh-oh-


And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.


Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?


We might.


Oh --


And bears!
What sort of an animal is that?


It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!


And him a brain.


I'm sure he could give you some courage.


Can't that female take no for an answer?


Oh --


Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?


Oh, he's just scared again.


No.  Why only --  Oh --


Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!


Oh! Something bit me, too!


Now come on - you're acting silly --


Dorothy!


I knew you would!


Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.


You've had plenty of time already!


Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!


Yes...!


...yes.


Look -- it ticks!


Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.


Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
